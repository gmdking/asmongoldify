Welcome to Asmongoldify, a versatile CLI audio degradation tool!
The original file is NOT MODIFIED in any way, shape, or form. The original file will not be corrupted or changed.
This ACTUALLY corrupts the file during the process, meaning it could produce potentially unplayable results.
It also generates an "intermediate" file, before doing actual file corruption.

If the script isn't running, here's steps you can take to remedy that.

1. Make sure python is installed.
    To download it, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version. Make sure to run and complete the installer

2. Install necessary packages.
    Packages required are as follows:
        scipy
        numpy
        pydub
        shutil

    To install them, follow these instructions.
        WINDOWS:
            1. Open command prompt
            2. Type and execute (press enter) the following commands:
                "pip install scipy"
                "pip install numpy"
                "pip install pydub"
                "pip install shutil"
            (Without quotes)
            Don't fret if some of these dont work, they are likely included with your python installation.
        LINUX (DEBIAN BASED)
            1. Open terminal
            2. Type and execute (press enter) the following commands:
                "sudo apt install python3-scipy"
                "sudo apt install python3-numpy"
                "sudo apt install python3-pydub"
                "sudo apt install python3-shutil"
            (Without quotes)
            Don't fret if some of these dont work, they are likely included with your python installation.

3. Open .py executable
	 Open a terminal/command prompt window, cd to the directory Asmongoldify is in, then run "python3 Asmongoldify.py" or "python Asmongoldify.py"
